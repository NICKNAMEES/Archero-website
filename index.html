    <section>A little about the game: This is a mobile role playing game that allows the user which is the archer to move around the various maps<br> and levels in order to progress into the enemies.<br>
         The enemies can shoot and kill your archer however your archer can shoot arrows<br>
          at the enemies automatically while the archer moves around. Be aware that you can dadge the enemy hits if you are<br>
           fast enoguh but the further you are, the harder the levels become. There are a total of seven worlds that you may enter<br>
           The player has to defeat over 50 enemies for each level so the levels are challenging to complete, but at the beggining of the game,<br>
           the user may choose their preferred abilities that they would want to start off with in order to better their chances against<br>
           the enemies.

       This is a picture of the archero character that is moving around the<br>
        map in order to try to complete the level and destroy the enemy. <br>
        This is the first default character
     that you receive when you <br> first start the game
        however as you progress through the game, you can obtain much<br>
        cooler character like mine on the Archer page. The first map is green then<br>
         they get darker and darker over the next six worlds that you enter.
